# Kiro Mode Integration Design

## Problem Statement

The original vibe-pm-agent MCP tools (`generate_requirements`, `generate_task_plan`) conflicted with Kiro's native mode structure:

- **Spec Mode**: Answers "WHAT to build" - structured requirements and specifications
- **Vibe Mode**: Answers "HOW to build" - implementation patterns and code generation  
- **PM Mode**: Answers "WHY to build" - business justification and strategic decisions

## Solution: PM-Focused MCP Server

### Design Philosophy

The redesigned vibe-pm-agent now focuses **exclusively on PM Mode** ("WHY to build") and **complements** rather than competes with Kiro's native capabilities.

### Clear Separation of Concerns

| Mode | Purpose | Tools | Responsibility |
|------|---------|-------|----------------|
| **PM Mode** (vibe-pm-agent) | WHY to build | Business analysis, ROI, strategy | MCP Server |
| **Spec Mode** (Kiro native) | WHAT to build | Requirements, specifications | Kiro IDE |
| **Vibe Mode** (Kiro native) | HOW to build | Implementation, code generation | Kiro IDE |

## New PM-Focused Tool Set

### 1. Business Opportunity Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyze market opportunity and business justification
- **Output**: Market analysis, problem validation, strategic fit assessment
- **Steering**: Creates business analysis steering files for strategic context

### 2. Business Case Generation  
- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive business case with ROI analysis
- **Output**: Financial projections, risk assessment, success metrics
- **Steering**: Creates business case steering files for project decisions

### 3. Stakeholder Communication
- **Purpose**: Generate executive communications (one-pagers, PR-FAQs, presentations)
- **Output**: Audience-specific communications for different stakeholders
- **Steering**: Creates communication steering files for stakeholder alignment

### 4. Strategic Alignment Assessment
- **Purpose**: Evaluate alignment with company strategy, OKRs, and vision
- **Output**: Alignment scoring, strategic impact analysis, recommendations
- **Steering**: Creates strategic alignment steering files for decision context

### 5. Resource Optimization Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyze and optimize resource allocation for development efficiency
- **Output**: Optimization opportunities, implementation roadmap, success metrics
- **Steering**: Creates optimization guidance for development teams

### 6. Market Timing Validation
- **Purpose**: Fast validation of market timing for feature development
- **Output**: Timing assessment, risk analysis, action plan
- **Steering**: Creates timing analysis for strategic decisions

## Integration Workflow

### Phase 1: Strategic Analysis (PM Mode - vibe-pm-agent)
1. **Business Opportunity Analysis** - Validate market opportunity and strategic fit
2. **Business Case Generation** - Create financial justification and ROI analysis
3. **Strategic Alignment Assessment** - Ensure alignment with company strategy
4. **Stakeholder Communication** - Generate executive communications

**Output**: Strategic context and business justification in steering files

### Phase 2: Requirements Definition (Spec Mode - Kiro native)
1. Use Kiro's native Spec Mode to create detailed requirements
2. Leverage PM Mode steering files for business context
3. Create structured specifications and acceptance criteria
4. Define technical constraints and success metrics

**Output**: Detailed requirements and specifications

### Phase 3: Implementation (Vibe Mode - Kiro native)
1. Use Kiro's native Vibe Mode for implementation guidance
2. Leverage Spec Mode requirements for implementation context
3. Generate code patterns and implementation strategies
4. Provide development guidance and best practices

**Output**: Implementation code and patterns

## Steering File Integration

### PM Mode Steering Files
- **Business Analysis**: Manual activation for strategic decisions
- **Business Cases**: Manual activation for project planning
- **Communications**: Manual activation for stakeholder meetings
- **Strategic Alignment**: Manual activation for strategic reviews

### Spec Mode Integration
- PM steering files provide business context for requirements
- Strategic alignment informs requirement prioritization
- Business case guides success criteria definition

### Vibe Mode Integration  
- Requirements from Spec Mode guide implementation
- PM context ensures implementation aligns with business goals
- Resource optimization guides development efficiency

## Benefits of This Design

### 1. Clear Separation of Concerns
- No overlap between MCP tools and Kiro native modes
- Each mode has distinct purpose and responsibility
- Clean integration points between modes

### 2. Complementary Functionality
- PM Mode provides strategic context for Spec Mode
- Spec Mode provides requirements context for Vibe Mode
- All modes work together seamlessly

### 3. Enhanced Decision Making
- Business justification before technical specification
- Strategic alignment throughout development process
- Comprehensive context for all development decisions

### 4. Improved Workflow
- Start with WHY (PM Mode) → Define WHAT (Spec Mode) → Implement HOW (Vibe Mode)
- Natural progression from strategy to implementation
- Context preservation throughout the process

## Example Usage Flow

### 1. Strategic Planning
```bash
# Use vibe-pm-agent PM Mode tools
analyze_business_opportunity → generate_business_case → assess_strategic_alignment
```
**Result**: Strategic context and business justification in steering files

### 2. Requirements Definition
```bash
# Use Kiro Spec Mode with PM context
Create spec with business context from PM steering files
Define requirements based on strategic alignment
```
**Result**: Detailed requirements with business context

### 3. Implementation
```bash
# Use Kiro Vibe Mode with Spec context  
Implement based on Spec Mode requirements
Leverage PM context for strategic alignment
```
**Result**: Implementation that aligns with business goals

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Users
1. **Immediate**: New PM-focused tools available alongside existing tools
2. **Transition**: Gradually migrate from `generate_requirements` to Kiro Spec Mode
3. **Optimization**: Use PM Mode for strategic analysis, Spec/Vibe for implementation

### For New Users
1. Start with PM Mode for business justification
2. Move to Spec Mode for requirements definition  
3. Use Vibe Mode for implementation guidance

## Technical Implementation

### MCP Server Changes
- Removed conflicting tools (`generate_requirements`, `generate_task_plan`)
- Added PM-focused tools for business analysis
- Enhanced steering integration for strategic context

### Steering File Strategy
- PM documents use manual activation for focused strategic use
- Business context available when needed for decision making
- No automatic activation to avoid overwhelming development context

### Integration Points
- PM steering files provide context for Spec Mode
- Spec requirements guide Vibe Mode implementation
- Clear handoff points between modes

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Clear understanding of when to use each mode
- Seamless workflow from strategy to implementation
- Reduced confusion about tool overlap

### Development Efficiency
- Faster strategic decision making with PM Mode
- Better requirements with business context
- More aligned implementation with strategic goals

### Business Value
- Stronger business justification for features
- Better strategic alignment throughout development
- Improved ROI through systematic analysis

## Conclusion

The redesigned vibe-pm-agent eliminates conflicts with Kiro's native modes by focusing exclusively on PM Mode ("WHY to build"). This creates a complementary ecosystem where:

- **PM Mode** (vibe-pm-agent) provides strategic context and business justification
- **Spec Mode** (Kiro) defines requirements with business context
- **Vibe Mode** (Kiro) implements solutions aligned with strategic goals

This design ensures each mode has a clear purpose while working together to provide comprehensive development support from strategy through implementation.
