# PM Document Best Practices

This guide provides best practices for creating high-quality PM documents using the Intent Optimizer tools.

## Document Quality Framework

### Pyramid Principle Application
All PM documents should follow the Pyramid Principle structure:

1. **Answer First**: Lead with the main recommendation or decision
2. **Supporting Reasons**: Provide 2-4 key reasons supporting the answer
3. **Evidence**: Include data, analysis, and supporting details

### Stakeholder Communication Standards

#### Executive Documents (One-Pagers)
**Purpose**: Enable fast, informed decision-making by leadership

**Structure Requirements**:
- **Answer (1 line)**: Clear decision and timing recommendation
- **Because (3 reasons)**: Core rationale supporting the decision
- **What (Scope)**: Specific deliverables and boundaries
- **Risks (3 key risks)**: Major concerns with specific mitigations
- **Options**: Conservative/Balanced/Bold with clear trade-offs
- **ROI Table**: Quantified effort, impact, cost, timing
- **Right-Time**: 2-4 lines explaining timing rationale

**Quality Criteria**:
- Under 120 lines (one page equivalent)
- Quantified benefits and costs
- Clear recommendation with confidence level
- Actionable next steps with owners

#### Product Communication (PR-FAQ)
**Purpose**: Align cross-functional teams on customer value and launch readiness

**Structure Requirements**:
- **Press Release**: Future-dated, under 250 words, customer-focused
- **FAQ**: Exactly 10 required questions with concise answers
- **Launch Checklist**: Scope freeze, owners, timeline, dependencies

**Quality Criteria**:
- Customer language (not internal jargon)
- Clear problem/solution fit
- Measurable success criteria
- Realistic timeline and dependencies

#### Requirements Documents
**Purpose**: Provide structured problem definition with prioritization

**Structure Requirements**:
- **Business Goal**: Clear WHY in 1-3 lines
- **User Needs**: Jobs, Pains, Gains from user perspective
- **Functional Requirements**: Specific WHAT deliverables
- **MoSCoW Prioritization**: Must/Should/Could/Won't with justification
- **Right-Time Verdict**: Go/No-Go decision with reasoning

**Quality Criteria**:
- Testable and measurable requirements
- Clear scope boundaries (what's NOT included)
- Realistic prioritization based on user value
- Actionable acceptance criteria

## Content Quality Standards

### Clarity and Precision
**Use Specific Language**:
- ❌ "Improve customer experience"
- ✅ "Reduce customer support response time from 4 hours to 1 hour"

**Quantify Benefits**:
- ❌ "Significant cost savings"
- ✅ "60% reduction in operational costs ($27,000 annual savings)"

**Define Success Clearly**:
- ❌ "Better user engagement"
- ✅ "Increase daily active users by 25% within 3 months"

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
**Include Supporting Data**:
- User research findings and quotes
- Market analysis and competitive intelligence
- Technical feasibility assessments
- Financial projections and ROI calculations

**Cite Sources**:
- Reference specific studies, surveys, or analyses
- Include confidence levels for estimates
- Acknowledge assumptions and limitations
- Provide links to detailed supporting materials

### Risk Assessment
**Identify Real Risks**:
- Technical complexity and integration challenges
- Market timing and competitive response
- Resource availability and team capabilities
- Regulatory or compliance requirements

**Provide Specific Mitigations**:
- ❌ "Monitor closely"
- ✅ "Weekly technical review with architecture team, fallback to manual process if automation fails"

## Stakeholder-Specific Guidelines

### For Engineering Teams
**Technical Requirements**:
- Include specific integration points and APIs
- Define performance requirements and SLAs
- Specify data models and storage requirements
- Address security and compliance needs

**Implementation Guidance**:
- Break down into manageable development tasks
- Include testing and validation requirements
- Specify deployment and rollback procedures
- Define monitoring and alerting needs

### For Executive Leadership
**Business Focus**:
- Lead with business impact and ROI
- Include competitive implications
- Address resource requirements and trade-offs
- Provide clear timeline and milestones

**Decision Support**:
- Present options with clear recommendations
- Quantify risks and mitigation costs
- Include market timing considerations
- Address strategic alignment and priorities

### For Cross-Functional Teams
**Coordination Requirements**:
- Define roles and responsibilities clearly
- Include dependencies and handoff points
- Specify communication and review processes
- Address training and change management needs

**Success Metrics**:
- Include metrics for all stakeholder groups
- Define measurement methods and frequency
- Specify reporting and review processes
- Address course correction procedures

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall: Vague Requirements
**Problem**: "Build a better dashboard"
**Solution**: "Create executive dashboard showing daily active users, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction scores with 5-second load time"

### Pitfall: Unrealistic Timelines
**Problem**: "Launch in 2 weeks"
**Solution**: Include Guardrails Check (Task 0) to validate feasibility against actual constraints

### Pitfall: Missing Stakeholder Alignment
**Problem**: Different teams have different understanding of scope
**Solution**: Use PR-FAQ format to ensure shared understanding of customer value and success criteria

### Pitfall: Insufficient Risk Assessment
**Problem**: "Low risk" without analysis
**Solution**: Include specific risks with probability, impact, and detailed mitigation plans

### Pitfall: Poor Option Analysis
**Problem**: Only one solution presented
**Solution**: Always provide Conservative/Balanced/Bold alternatives with clear trade-offs

## Document Review Process

### Self-Review Checklist
Before sharing documents, verify:

**Structure**:
- [ ] Follows Pyramid Principle (Answer → Reasons → Evidence)
- [ ] Includes all required sections for document type
- [ ] Stays within length limits (120 lines for one-pagers)
- [ ] Uses clear headings and formatting

**Content**:
- [ ] Quantifies benefits and costs where possible
- [ ] Includes specific success metrics and measurement methods
- [ ] Addresses realistic risks with specific mitigations
- [ ] Provides clear recommendations with confidence levels

**Stakeholder Alignment**:
- [ ] Uses appropriate language for target audience
- [ ] Addresses key concerns and questions
- [ ] Includes actionable next steps with owners
- [ ] Specifies review and approval processes

### Peer Review Guidelines
When reviewing others' documents:

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Clarity**: Can a new team member understand the proposal?
2. **Completeness**: Are all key questions answered?
3. **Feasibility**: Are timelines and resource estimates realistic?
4. **Value**: Is the business case compelling and well-supported?

**Feedback Format**:
- Specific suggestions rather than general comments
- Questions that help clarify assumptions
- Alternative perspectives or approaches to consider
- References to similar projects or industry examples

### Stakeholder Review Process
**Review Sequence**:
1. **Technical Review**: Engineering feasibility and architecture
2. **Business Review**: Market need, competitive analysis, ROI
3. **User Review**: Actual user needs and workflow integration
4. **Executive Review**: Strategic alignment and resource allocation

**Review Criteria**:
- Each reviewer focuses on their area of expertise
