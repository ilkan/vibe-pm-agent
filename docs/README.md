## Key Features

### üîÑ Automatic Conversion
- Transform PM agent outputs into properly formatted steering files
- Smart front-matter generation with appropriate inclusion rules
- Automatic cross-reference creation between related documents

### üéØ Contextual Activation
- **Always**: Core principles active in every interaction
- **FileMatch**: Feature-specific guidance activated by file patterns
- **Manual**: Executive summaries and reference materials on-demand

### üèóÔ∏è Flexible Organization
- **Feature-based**: Organize by project features
- **Type-based**: Organize by document types
- **Hybrid**: Mix of always-active, contextual, and manual guidance

### üîó Smart Cross-References
- Automatic linking between requirements, design, and implementation
- References to related specs and documentation
- Bidirectional relationship management

## Common Workflows

### Basic Workflow: Single Document
```typescript
// Generate requirements with steering file
const result = await mcp_pm_agent_intent_optimizer_generate_requirements({
  raw_intent: "Create user authentication system",
  context: {
    createSteeringFile: true,
    featureName: "user-authentication"
  }
});
```

### Advanced Workflow: Complete Feature Suite
```typescript
// Generate complete workflow with steering files
const workflow = await createCompleteWorkflowWithSteering(
  "Create user authentication with OAuth and RBAC",
  "user-authentication"
);
// Creates: requirements, design, tasks, and onepager steering files
```

### Team Workflow: Collaborative Development
1. **PM**: Generate requirements and one-pager with steering files
2. **Architect**: Generate design options with steering files
3. **Tech Lead**: Generate task plan with steering files
4. **Developers**: Implementation guided by contextual steering files
