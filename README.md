**The PM Agent ensures AI teams build the right feature at the right time.** It validates intent with consulting frameworks, forecasts ROI, and produces artifacts (specs, one-pagers, PR-FAQ) that align devs, PMs, and execs before costly build cycles.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**Developers lack systematic approaches to optimize workflows and justify technical decisions** because they don't have access to professional business analysis frameworks. They build first, optimize later (if ever), leading to:

- 💸 **Potentially inefficient patterns** without systematic analysis of alternatives
- ⏰ **Hours spent** on manual optimization that professional frameworks could streamline  
- 🎲 **Guesswork** instead of structured decision-making on architecture choices
- 📊 **No professional analysis** to justify technical decisions to stakeholders

## 💡 Our Solution: AI-Powered Consulting Arsenal

**Vibe PM Agent** is the world's first AI system that applies **7 professional consulting techniques** to automatically optimize developer workflows and generate executive-ready documentation.

### 🧠 Consulting Techniques Arsenal
- **MECE Framework**: Break down quota drivers into mutually exclusive categories
- **Pyramid Principle**: Structure recommendations with answer-first clarity
- **Value Driver Tree**: Decompose costs into measurable optimization opportunities  
- **Zero-Based Design**: Propose radical "from scratch" efficient approaches
- **Impact vs Effort Matrix**: Prioritize optimizations by ROI potential
- **Value Proposition Canvas**: Link user needs to optimized solutions
- **Option Framing**: Generate Conservative/Balanced/Bold alternatives

### 🎯 Key Innovation: The Missing Third Dimension

**Product Management has three isomorphic dimensions:**
- **Spec Mode**: Answers "WHAT to build" - structured requirements and specifications
- **Vibe Mode**: Answers "HOW to build" - implementation patterns and code generation  
- **PM Mode**: Answers "WHY to build" - business justification and strategic decisions

**Vibe PM Agent fills the missing third dimension:**

```typescript
// Complete Product Development Cycle
Spec Mode: "Build user authentication system" → Structured requirements
Vibe Mode: "Implement OAuth with JWT tokens" → Generated code and tests
PM Mode: "Why build auth now vs later?" → Business analysis and ROI justification

// Vibe PM Agent bridges all three:
validate_idea_quick("Add social login to increase conversion") 
→ WHY: Business case with 3 strategic options
→ WHAT: Structured requirements with MoSCoW prioritization  
→ HOW: Optimized implementation approach with technical recommendations
```

### 🔄 Self-Improving System with Kiro Agent Steering

**Every PM analysis becomes persistent institutional knowledge** through deep integration with Kiro's Agent Steering system:

#### 🧠 **Automatic Knowledge Capture**
- **Requirements Analysis** → Steering files that guide future feature development
- **Design Options** → Architectural guidance patterns for similar problems
- **Executive One-Pagers** → Templates and frameworks for stakeholder communication
- **ROI Analyses** → Benchmarks and cost models for future investment decisions

#### 🔄 **Continuous Learning Loop**
```typescript
// Self-Improving Development Cycle
PM Analysis → Steering Files → Future Development Guidance → Better Decisions → Enhanced Analysis
```

#### 📚 **Institutional Knowledge Building**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server won't start**
   - Ensure the project is built: `npm run build`
   - Check that Node.js version is compatible (>= 16)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

2. **MCP client can't connect**
   - Verify the path to `bin/mcp-server.js` is correct in your MCP configuration
   - Check that the script is executable: `chmod +x bin/mcp-server.js`
   - Review server logs for startup errors

3. **Tool calls failing**
   - Enable debug logging: `--log-level debug`
   - Check the health endpoint if enabled
   - Verify input schemas match the expected format

### Logging

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
node bin/mcp-server.js --log-level debug --health-check
```

Log levels (from most to least verbose):
- `debug`: Detailed execution information
- `info`: General operational messages
- `warn`: Warning conditions
- `error`: Error conditions
- `fatal`: Critical errors that cause shutdown
