**Completes Kiro's development trinity:** PM Mode (WHY) + Spec Mode (WHAT) + Vibe Mode (HOW)

## 🎯 The Missing Piece

Kiro has **Spec Mode** (WHAT to build) and **Vibe Mode** (HOW to build), but lacks **PM Mode** (WHY to build). Teams jump into implementation without strategic justification:

- 💸 No business case or ROI analysis
- ⏰ Missing market timing validation  
- 🎲 No stakeholder alignment
- 📊 Lack of executive communication

## 💡 Solution: PM Mode for Kiro

**Vibe PM Agent** adds the missing **PM Mode** with professional consulting-grade analysis.

### 🎯 Kiro Development Trinity

| Mode | Purpose | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| **PM Mode** | WHY to build | Business analysis, ROI, strategy |
| **Spec Mode** | WHAT to build | Requirements, specifications |
| **Vibe Mode** | HOW to build | Implementation, code generation |

### 🔄 Integrated Workflow

```typescript
1. PM Mode: "Why build auth now?" → Business case + market timing
2. Spec Mode: "What auth features?" → Requirements (with PM context)  
3. Vibe Mode: "How to implement?" → Code (with Spec requirements)
```

### 🧠 Key Capabilities
- **Market Timing Validation**: Fast right-time analysis for feature decisions
- **Business Case Generation**: ROI analysis with risk assessment and strategic alignment
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Executive one-pagers, PR-FAQs, board presentations
- **Kiro Steering Integration**: PM analysis becomes persistent development context
