[![Kiro Integration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kiro-PM%20Mode-purple)](https://kiro.ai)

**The PM Agent completes Kiro's development trinity** by providing strategic business analysis and justification that feeds into Kiro's native Spec Mode (requirements) and Vibe Mode (implementation).

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**Kiro has powerful Spec Mode (WHAT to build) and Vibe Mode (HOW to build), but lacks PM Mode (WHY to build).** This creates a gap where teams jump into requirements and implementation without strategic business justification:

- 💸 **Features built without business case** - No ROI analysis or strategic alignment
- ⏰ **Missing market timing analysis** - Build at wrong time, miss opportunities  
- 🎲 **No stakeholder alignment** - Technical teams and executives speak different languages
- 📊 **Lack of professional PM artifacts** - No one-pagers, business cases, or strategic communications

## 💡 Our Solution: PM Mode for Kiro

**Vibe PM Agent** completes Kiro's development trinity by providing the missing **PM Mode** that answers "WHY to build" questions with professional consulting-grade analysis.

### 🎯 Perfect Integration with Kiro Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Responsibility | Tools |
|------|---------|----------------|-------|
| **PM Mode** | WHY to build | vibe-pm-agent MCP | Business analysis, strategy, ROI |
| **Spec Mode** | WHAT to build | Kiro native | Requirements, specifications |
| **Vibe Mode** | HOW to build | Kiro native | Implementation, code generation |

### 🔄 Seamless Workflow Integration

```typescript
// Complete Kiro Development Cycle
1. PM Mode: "Why build user authentication now?" 
   → Business case, market timing, strategic alignment

2. Spec Mode: "What authentication features to build?"
   → Requirements, specifications (with PM context from steering files)

3. Vibe Mode: "How to implement OAuth with JWT?"
   → Code generation, patterns (with Spec requirements)

// Perfect complementary functionality - no conflicts!
```

```

#### Complete Kiro Development Flow
```bash
# Phase 1: PM Mode (Strategic Analysis)
PM Mode: analyze_business_opportunity + generate_business_case
→ Creates steering files with strategic context

# Phase 2: Spec Mode (Requirements with Business Context)
Kiro Spec Mode: Create requirements and specifications
→ Steering files automatically provide business context

# Phase 3: Vibe Mode (Implementation with Requirements Context)  
Kiro Vibe Mode: Generate implementation code and patterns

npm run build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration
```

### Development Mode

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server won't start**
   - Ensure the project is built: `npm run build`
   - Check that Node.js version is compatible (>= 16)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

2. **MCP client can't connect**
   - Verify the path to `bin/mcp-server.js` is correct in your MCP configuration
   - Check that the script is executable: `chmod +x bin/mcp-server.js`
   - Review server logs for startup errors

3. **Tool calls failing**
   - Enable debug logging: `--log-level debug`
   - Check the health endpoint if enabled
   - Verify input schemas match the expected format

### Logging

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
node bin/mcp-server.js --log-level debug --health-check
```

Log levels (from most to least verbose):
- `debug`: Detailed execution information
- `info`: General operational messages
- `warn`: Warning conditions
- `error`: Error conditions
- `fatal`: Critical errors that cause shutdown
