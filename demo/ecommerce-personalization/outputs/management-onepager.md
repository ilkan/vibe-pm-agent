# Executive One-Pager: AI Personalization Engine

## Answer
**Build incremental personalization engine now** - 12-week phased approach delivers 35% conversion improvement ($1.2M annual revenue) with manageable ML complexity, perfectly timed for Q4 holiday season.

## Because
- **Revenue Plateau**: 2.3% conversion rate stagnation costs $1.2M annually in lost revenue opportunity with clear technical solution
- **CAC Pressure**: $45 customer acquisition cost requires better conversion efficiency to maintain healthy unit economics as marketing scales
- **Competitive Necessity**: 50K+ product catalog without personalization creates poor user experience vs. Amazon-level expectations

## What (Scope Today)
- Phase 1: Collaborative filtering for "customers also bought" recommendations on product pages (Week 1-4)
- Phase 2: Behavioral tracking and homepage personalization based on browsing history (Week 5-8)  
- Phase 3: Email campaign personalization and advanced segmentation (Week 9-12)
- Real-time recommendation API with A/B testing framework for continuous optimization
- Analytics dashboard for marketing team to track personalization performance

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: ML complexity overwhelms team leading to maintenance nightmare and technical debt
  **Mitigation**: Start with proven collaborative filtering algorithms, build internal ML expertise gradually with external consulting support

- **Risk**: Personalization system doesn't improve conversion rates as projected
  **Mitigation**: A/B testing framework from day one, fallback to third-party solutions (Algolia, Dynamic Yield) if internal build underperforms

- **Risk**: Holiday season timeline pressure leads to rushed implementation and poor user experience
  **Mitigation**: Phased rollout with Phase 1 live by September for Q4 preparation, advanced features as post-holiday improvements

## Options
- **Incremental**: Collaborative filtering + basic personalization (12 weeks, 35% conversion improvement, $150K investment)
- **Comprehensive ✅**: Full ML platform with advanced analytics (20 weeks, 80% conversion improvement, $250K investment)
- **Buy vs Build**: Third-party integration with Algolia/Dynamic Yield (6 weeks, 50% conversion improvement, $60K annual licensing)

## ROI Snapshot
| Option        | Effort | Impact | Est. Cost | Timing |
|---------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Incremental   | Med    | High   | $150K     | Now    |
| Comprehensive ✅ | High   | VeryH  | $250K     | Now    |
| Buy vs Build  | Low    | High   | $60K/yr   | Now    |

## Right-Time Recommendation
**Build Comprehensive approach starting now** - Q4 holiday season represents 40% of annual revenue, making conversion optimization critical for year-end performance. 20-week timeline allows Phase 1 delivery by September for holiday preparation while building long-term competitive advantage.

Incremental approach leaves significant revenue on table ($800K vs. $2M potential). Buy vs Build creates ongoing licensing costs ($300K over 5 years) without building internal ML capability that becomes competitive moat for international expansion.

*Decision confidence: High - Clear revenue impact, proven technical approaches, strategic timing for holiday season*
