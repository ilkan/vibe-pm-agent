# Kiro Integration: Churn Prediction Steering Files

## Generated Steering Context

The PM Mode analysis automatically generates steering files that provide persistent context for future Spec and Vibe mode development:

### `.kiro/steering/churn-prediction-context.md`
```markdown
# Churn Prediction Project Context

## Business Justification
- **Revenue Impact**: $384K annual retention opportunity
- **Strategic Timing**: Series B preparation requires churn metrics improvement
- **ROI**: 1,340% first-year return with 2.1 month payback

## Technical Constraints
- **Budget**: $35K development budget constraint
- **Timeline**: 8-week delivery for Series B preparation
- **Team**: 2 engineers + 1 data scientist + 1 PM

## Success Metrics
- Churn rate: 15% → 10% (5% reduction target)
- CS efficiency: 40% improvement in proactive interactions
- Revenue retention: $384K annually

## Architecture Decisions
- Start rule-based, add ML incrementally (risk mitigation)
- Slack/email integration for CS team workflow
- Customer health scoring with intervention playbooks

*Use this context when generating specs or implementing features*
```

### `.kiro/steering/customer-success-requirements.md`
```markdown
# Customer Success Team Requirements

## User Workflow Context
- **Current State**: Manual spreadsheet tracking, reactive support
- **Target State**: Proactive intervention with 30-day early warning
- **Team Size**: 4 people managing 450 customers (112 customers per person)

## Integration Requirements
- Slack notifications for urgent alerts
- Email summaries for weekly customer health reports
- Dashboard accessible on mobile for field customer meetings

## Success Criteria from CS Team
- Reduce time spent on reactive firefighting by 40%
- Increase proactive customer conversations by 3x
- Improve customer satisfaction scores through early intervention

*Apply these requirements when designing CS-facing features*
```

## Spec Mode Integration

When developers later use Spec Mode to define specific features, they'll have this PM context automatically available:

```yaml
# Example: .kiro/specs/churn-alerts/requirements.md gets this context:

Business Context: |
  Part of $384K revenue retention initiative with 1,340% ROI target.
  Critical for Series B fundraising metrics (churn rate improvement).
  
User Context: |
  CS team of 4 managing 450 customers needs proactive alerts.
  Current manual process causes $32K monthly preventable losses.
  
Success Metrics: |
  - Reduce churn rate from 15% to 10%
  - 40% CS efficiency improvement
  - 2.1 month payback period
```

## Vibe Mode Integration

When implementing code, developers get strategic context in their prompts:

```typescript
// Auto-generated context for Vibe Mode:
/*
 * BUSINESS CONTEXT: Churn prediction feature
 * Revenue Impact: $384K annual retention opportunity
 * Timeline: Critical for Series B prep (8 weeks)
 * Success Metric: 15% → 10% churn rate reduction
 * 
 * TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
 * - Start rule-based, add ML incrementally
 * - Slack integration required for CS workflow
 * - Mobile-friendly dashboard for field meetings
 */

// Implementation with business context awareness
class ChurnPredictor {
  // TODO: Implement rule-based scoring first (risk mitigation)
  // TODO: Add Slack webhook for CS team alerts
  // TODO: Ensure mobile responsiveness for field use
}
```

## Self-Improving Development Workflow

1. **PM Mode** → Business case with strategic context
2. **Steering Files** → Persistent context for future development  
3. **Spec Mode** → Requirements with business justification
4. **Vibe Mode** → Implementation with strategic awareness
5. **Feedback Loop** → Results update steering context for next features

This creates a **compound learning effect** where each feature builds on accumulated business and user context, making the entire development process more strategically informed over time.

## Example: Next Feature Development

When the team later wants to add "Expansion Prediction" (identifying upsell opportunities), the steering files provide:

- **Business Context**: Proven $384K retention success, now focus on growth
- **Technical Foundation**: Existing ML infrastructure and customer health scoring
- **User Workflow**: CS team already trained on predictive alerts, expand to opportunities
- **Success Metrics**: Benchmark against churn prediction ROI for comparison

*This demonstrates how PM Mode creates lasting strategic intelligence that improves all future development decisions.*
