# Executive One-Pager: Churn Prediction Dashboard

## Answer
**Build predictive churn dashboard now** - 8-week timeline delivers $384K annual revenue retention with 1,340% ROI, perfectly timed for Series B fundraising metrics.

## Because
- **Revenue Impact**: 15% churn rate costs $384K annually in preventable revenue loss with clear technical solution path
- **Series B Timing**: Churn reduction directly improves key SaaS metrics (LTV, CAC payback) that investors evaluate for scaling readiness
- **Competitive Advantage**: Custom integration creates $24-60K annual savings vs. ChurnZero/Gainsight while building proprietary data moat

## What (Scope Today)
- ML-powered 30-day churn prediction engine using existing product usage, support, and billing data
- Automated alert workflows with Slack/email integration for customer success team
- Customer health scoring dashboard with intervention playbook automation
- Phase 0: Data audit and CS workflow analysis (Week 1-2)
- MVP: Basic predictive alerts (Week 3-6)  
- Full platform: Advanced workflows and reporting (Week 7-8)

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: ML model accuracy below expectations leading to alert fatigue
  **Mitigation**: Start with rule-based system, add ML incrementally with CS team feedback loop

- **Risk**: Customer Success team doesn't adopt new workflow tools
  **Mitigation**: Co-design with CS team, gradual rollout with dedicated training and change management

- **Risk**: Development timeline extends beyond 8-week Series B preparation window
  **Mitigation**: MVP-first approach with core alerts deliverable in 4 weeks, advanced features as Phase 2

## Options
- **Conservative**: Basic alert dashboard with manual workflows ($25K, 980% ROI, 4-week timeline)
- **Balanced ✅**: Predictive dashboard with automation ($35K, 1,340% ROI, 8-week timeline)  
- **Bold (ZBD)**: Comprehensive platform with advanced ML ($65K, 1,020% ROI, 12-week timeline)

## ROI Snapshot
| Option        | Effort | Impact | Est. Cost | Timing |
|---------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Conservative  | Low    | Med    | $25K      | Now    |
| Balanced ✅   | Med    | High   | $35K      | Now    |
| Bold (ZBD)    | High   | VeryH  | $65K      | Later  |

## Right-Time Recommendation
**Build now with Balanced approach** - Series B fundraising timeline creates perfect urgency for churn metrics improvement. 8-week delivery window aligns with investor due diligence preparation while $384K annual revenue retention provides compelling ROI story. Waiting risks missing fundraising narrative opportunity and continued $32K monthly revenue loss.

Conservative approach leaves money on table with only 3% churn reduction vs. 5% achievable with predictive ML. Bold approach misses Series B timing window and shows diminishing ROI returns due to over-engineering complexity.
