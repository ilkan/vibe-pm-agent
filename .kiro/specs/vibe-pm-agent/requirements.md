# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vibe PM Agent is an AI-powered system that transforms raw developer intent expressed in natural language into structured, efficient Kiro specifications. The system applies 2-3 consulting and business analysis techniques from a comprehensive toolkit to minimize vibe/spec quota consumption while preserving all required functionality. This tool provides consulting-style analysis with ROI estimates and multiple optimization alternatives.

The system operates as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, exposing AI agent capabilities through well-defined tools that can be called by other AI systems like Kiro, enabling seamless integration while maintaining sophisticated multi-phase analysis internally.
