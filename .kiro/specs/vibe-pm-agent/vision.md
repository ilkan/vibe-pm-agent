# Vision: Vibe PM Agent - Complete Kiro Development Trinity

## WHY (Business Justification)

**The Missing PM Mode Problem:**
Kiro currently provides excellent WHAT (Spec Mode) and HOW (Vibe Mode) capabilities, but lacks the critical WHY component that answers "should we build this and when?" This gap forces developers to make strategic decisions without proper business analysis, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and missed market opportunities.

**Market Opportunity:**
- AI IDE adoption accelerating with 300% growth in developer productivity tools
- PM-developer collaboration gap costs teams 40% efficiency in feature prioritization
- Executive stakeholders need business justification for technical decisions
- Right-time decision making critical as development costs increase

**Strategic Value:**
The Vibe PM Agent completes Kiro's development trinity, positioning it as the only AI IDE that addresses the complete development lifecycle from strategic justification through implementation. This creates a defensible moat in the competitive AI IDE landscape.
