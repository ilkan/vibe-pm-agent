# Design Options for Vibe PM Agent Hackathon Enhancement

## Problem Framing

The current vibe-pm-agent needs significant enhancement to achieve hackathon excellence with Kiro's AI IDE features. We need to transform it from a basic MCP server into a production-ready PM Mode that demonstrates spec-driven development, steering integration, and measurable performance improvements.

**Why Now (3-5 lines):**
The hackathon deadline creates urgency for demonstrating Kiro's complete development trinity (WHY/WHAT/HOW). Current implementation lacks canonical Kiro artifacts, steering integration, and production readiness signals that judges expect. Market timing is perfect as AI IDE adoption accelerates and PM-developer collaboration becomes critical. The 5-minute judge validation requirement demands immediate focus on discoverability and evidence artifacts.

## Design Options

### Option 1: Conservative (Incremental Enhancement)
**Summary:** Enhance existing codebase with minimal structural changes, focusing on adding missing artifacts and basic steering integration.

**Key Tradeoffs:**
- ✅ Lower implementation risk, builds on existing foundation
- ✅ Faster delivery with incremental improvements
- ❌ Limited innovation showcase, may not differentiate sufficiently
- ❌ Misses opportunity for architectural improvements

**Impact:** Medium - Meets basic requirements but limited wow factor
**Effort:** Low - Mostly additive changes to existing structure
**Major Risks:** 
- May not achieve target hackathon scores (95-100)
- Limited demonstration of Kiro's unique capabilities

### Option 2: Balanced (Spec-Driven Enhancement) ✅ RECOMMENDED
**Summary:** Implement comprehensive spec-driven development with canonical Kiro artifacts, steering integration, and production readiness while maintaining existing MCP foundation.

**Key Tradeoffs:**
- ✅ Demonstrates complete Kiro workflow (spec → steering → hooks → tools)
- ✅ Production-ready with health checks, CI, and performance evidence
- ✅ Clear differentiation with PM-specific innovations
- ⚖️ Moderate complexity increase with structured approach
- ❌ Requires careful scope management to meet deadline

**Impact:** High - Strong hackathon positioning with clear value demonstration
**Effort:** Medium - Structured enhancement with clear deliverables
**Major Risks:**
- Scope creep if not carefully managed
- Integration complexity between new and existing components

### Option 3: Bold (Zero-Based Redesign)
**Summary:** Complete architectural redesign with advanced AI agent capabilities, multi-modal interfaces, and cutting-edge PM automation features.

**Key Tradeoffs:**
- ✅ Maximum innovation potential and differentiation
- ✅ Opportunity for breakthrough PM automation capabilities
- ❌ High implementation risk with tight timeline
- ❌ May sacrifice stability for innovation
- ❌ Complex integration with existing Kiro ecosystem

**Impact:** Very High - Potential for breakthrough innovation
**Effort:** High - Significant architectural changes required
**Major Risks:**
- Timeline risk with hackathon deadline
- Integration complexity may prevent completion
- Over-engineering for hackathon context

## Impact vs Effort Matrix

### High Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins)
- **Conservative Option**: Basic artifact creation and steering files
- Canonical spec files (.yaml, tasks.md, design_options.md, vision.md)
- Basic steering rules and prompt templates

### High Impact, High Effort (Strategic Investments)
- **Balanced Option**: Complete spec-driven workflow with production readiness
- **Bold Option**: Zero-based redesign with advanced capabilities

### Low Impact, Low Effort (Nice to Have)
- Additional documentation and examples
- Extended test coverage beyond requirements

### Low Impact, High Effort (Avoid)
- Over-engineered solutions that don't demonstrate core value
- Complex features that don't align with hackathon judging criteria

## Chosen Option: Balanced (Spec-Driven Enhancement)

**Rationale (2-4 lines):**
The Balanced option optimally addresses hackathon requirements by demonstrating Kiro's complete spec-driven development workflow while maintaining deliverable scope. It provides clear differentiation through PM-specific innovations and production readiness signals that judges expect. The structured approach with canonical artifacts creates undeniable evidence of Kiro integration while keeping implementation risk manageable within the hackathon timeline.

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Phase 1**: Canonical Kiro artifacts and steering integration
2. **Phase 2**: Production readiness (CI, health checks, performance evidence)
3. **Phase 3**: PM-specific innovations (risk register, scope chisel)
4. **Phase 4**: Judge Fast-Path and documentation polish

**Success Metrics:**
- P0 Kiro AI IDE Features: 100/100 score
- P0 Technical Complexity: 95-100 score  
- P1 Innovation & Creativity: 95-100 score
- 5-minute judge validation path
- >80% test coverage with CI green
- Performance evidence with p50/p95 latencies
