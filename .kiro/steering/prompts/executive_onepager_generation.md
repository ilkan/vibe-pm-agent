# Executive One-Pager Generation Prompt Template

## Context
You are creating an executive-ready management one-pager for: {feature_name}

## Input Variables
- **Requirements Document**: {requirements_content}
- **Design Document**: {design_content}
- **Business Case**: {business_case_analysis}
- **ROI Analysis**: {roi_projections}
- **Market Intelligence**: {market_research}
- **Risk Assessment**: {risk_analysis}

## Document Structure (Maximum 120 lines)

### Answer (Pyramid Principle - Answer First)
**One-line decision and timing recommendation with confidence score**

**Template**: 
"RECOMMENDATION: {PROCEED|DELAY|REJECT} with {solution_name} - {timing_recommendation} (Confidence: {confidence_score}%)"

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Decision must be backed by ROI analysis with confidence intervals
- Timing must reference market window analysis and competitive intelligence
- Confidence score must be calculated from evidence quality assessment

### Because (3 Core Supporting Reasons)
**Exactly 3 bullet points with evidence-backed rationale**

**Reason 1: {Business Impact}**
- {Quantified business benefit} supported by {market_research_citation}
- {Customer validation data} with {sample_size} and {confidence_interval}
- {Competitive advantage} validated through {competitive_analysis_source}

**Reason 2: {Market Opportunity}**
- {Market size and growth} from {industry_report_citation}
- {Customer demand evidence} with {validation_methodology}
- {Timing factors} supported by {trend_analysis_source}

**Reason 3: {Strategic Alignment}**
- {Company OKR alignment} with {strategic_priority_reference}
- {Resource availability} confirmed through {capacity_analysis}
- {Risk mitigation} validated by {comparable_project_data}

### What (Scope and Deliverables Today)
**Clear scope definition with measurable outcomes**

**Core Deliverables**:
- {Deliverable_1}: {Success_metric} by {Timeline} (Source: {Benchmark_data})
- {Deliverable_2}: {Success_metric} by {Timeline} (Source: {Benchmark_data})
- {Deliverable_3}: {Success_metric} by {Timeline} (Source: {Benchmark_data})

**Success Criteria**:
- {Primary_KPI}: Target {Target_value} (Current baseline: {Baseline_value})
- {Secondary_KPI}: Target {Target_value} (Industry benchmark: {Benchmark_value})
- {Tertiary_KPI}: Target {Target_value} (Measurement method: {Method})

### Risks and Mitigations (Top 3 Risks)
**Risk assessment with probability, impact, and specific mitigation strategies**

**Risk 1: {Risk_description}**
- **Probability**: {Percentage}% (Source: {Historical_data_reference})
- **Impact**: {Quantified_impact} (Source: {Impact_analysis})
- **Mitigation**: {Specific_action} (Owner: {Responsible_party}, Timeline: {Deadline})

**Risk 2: {Risk_description}**
- **Probability**: {Percentage}% (Source: {Historical_data_reference})
- **Impact**: {Quantified_impact} (Source: {Impact_analysis})
- **Mitigation**: {Specific_action} (Owner: {Responsible_party}, Timeline: {Deadline})

**Risk 3: {Risk_description}**
- **Probability**: {Percentage}% (Source: {Historical_data_reference})
- **Impact**: {Quantified_impact} (Source: {Impact_analysis})
- **Mitigation**: {Specific_action} (Owner: {Responsible_party}, Timeline: {Deadline})

### Options Analysis (Conservative/Balanced/Bold)

**Conservative Approach**:
- **Summary**: {One_line_description}
- **Investment**: {Cost_estimate} ± {Confidence_interval}
- **Timeline**: {Duration_estimate} ± {Confidence_interval}
- **ROI**: {ROI_percentage} (Source: {Comparable_project_data})

**Balanced Approach ✅ (RECOMMENDED)**:
- **Summary**: {One_line_description}
- **Investment**: {Cost_estimate} ± {Confidence_interval}
- **Timeline**: {Duration_estimate} ± {Confidence_interval}
- **ROI**: {ROI_percentage} (Source: {Comparable_project_data})

**Bold Approach**:
- **Summary**: {One_line_description}
- **Investment**: {Cost_estimate} ± {Confidence_interval}
- **Timeline**: {Duration_estimate} ± {Confidence_interval}
- **ROI**: {ROI_percentage} (Source: {Comparable_project_data})

### ROI Snapshot Table

| Option | Effort | Impact | Est. Cost | Timeline | ROI | Confidence |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|-----|------------|
| Conservative | {Low/Med/High} | {Med/High} | {Cost_range} | {Timeline} | {ROI%} | {Confidence%} |
| Balanced ✅ | {Low/Med/High} | {High/VeryH} | {Cost_range} | {Timeline} | {ROI%} | {Confidence%} |
| Bold | {Med/High} | {VeryH} | {Cost_range} | {Timeline} | {ROI%} | {Confidence%} |

**Table Evidence Requirements**:
- All cost estimates must reference comparable project data
- ROI calculations must include sensitivity analysis
- Confidence scores must reflect evidence quality assessment
- Timeline estimates must account for resource availability

### Right-Time Recommendation (2-4 lines)
**Market-based rationale for timing decision with competitive implications**

**Market Window Analysis**:
{Market_timing_assessment} based on {Market_research_source}. {Competitive_pressure_analysis} indicates {Urgency_level}. {Customer_readiness_assessment} suggests {Optimal_timing}. Delaying {Delay_period} would result in {Opportunity_cost} (Source: {Market_analysis}).

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Market timing must cite current industry reports and trend analysis
- Competitive pressure must reference verified competitive intelligence
- Customer readiness must be supported by customer research data
- Opportunity cost must be quantified with confidence intervals
