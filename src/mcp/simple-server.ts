# PM Agent Analysis: Intent Optimization

## Original Intent
${intent}

## Consulting Analysis Applied
- **MECE Framework**: Categorized quota drivers into 3 main areas
- **Value Driver Tree**: Identified key cost optimization opportunities
- **Option Framing**: Generated Conservative, Balanced, and Bold approaches

## Optimization Results

### Conservative Approach (Recommended)
- **Strategy**: Batch similar operations, add basic caching
- **Quota Savings**: 40-50%
- **Implementation Effort**: Low
- **Risk Level**: Low

### Balanced Approach
- **Strategy**: Advanced batching, intelligent caching, spec decomposition
- **Quota Savings**: 60-70%
- **Implementation Effort**: Medium
- **Risk Level**: Medium

### Bold Approach (Zero-Based Design)
- **Strategy**: Complete workflow redesign with event-driven architecture
- **Quota Savings**: 80-90%
- **Implementation Effort**: High
- **Risk Level**: High

## ROI Analysis
- **Current Estimated Cost**: $20/month (naive implementation)
- **Optimized Cost**: $8/month (Conservative approach)
- **Savings**: $12/month (60% reduction)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Implement Conservative approach first
2. Monitor performance and cost savings
3. Consider Balanced approach after validation
4. Evaluate Bold approach for high-volume scenarios

## Generated Kiro Spec
\`\`\`yaml
name: optimized-workflow
description: Optimized implementation with batching and caching
requirements:
  - Batch operations to reduce API calls
  - Implement caching layer for repeated queries
  - Use scheduled specs instead of real-time processing
tasks:
  - Implement batching logic
  - Add caching mechanism
  - Create scheduled execution workflow

# Workflow Analysis Report

## Workflow Overview
- **ID**: ${workflowId}
- **Steps**: ${stepCount}
- **Complexity**: ${stepCount > 5 ? 'High' : stepCount > 2 ? 'Medium' : 'Low'}

## Consulting Techniques Applied

### MECE Analysis
**Quota Driver Categories:**
1. **Data Retrieval Operations**: ${Math.floor(stepCount * 0.4)} steps
2. **Processing Operations**: ${Math.floor(stepCount * 0.4)} steps  
3. **Output Operations**: ${Math.floor(stepCount * 0.2)} steps

### Impact vs Effort Matrix
**High Impact, Low Effort:**
- Implement result caching
- Batch similar API calls

**High Impact, Medium Effort:**
- Optimize data retrieval patterns
- Implement async processing

**Medium Impact, Low Effort:**
- Add request deduplication
- Optimize payload sizes

## Optimization Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Immediate)
- **Add caching layer**: 30-40% quota reduction
- **Batch operations**: 20-30% quota reduction

### Priority 2 (Short-term)
- **Async processing**: 15-25% quota reduction
- **Data optimization**: 10-20% quota reduction

### Priority 3 (Long-term)
- **Workflow redesign**: 40-60% quota reduction
- **Event-driven architecture**: 50-70% quota reduction

## Estimated Savings
- **Current Cost**: $${stepCount * 2}/execution
- **Optimized Cost**: $${Math.ceil(stepCount * 0.6)}/execution
- **Savings**: ${Math.floor(40)}% reduction

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Week 1: Implement caching
2. Week 2: Add batching logic
3. Week 3: Optimize data retrieval
4. Week 4: Performance testing and validation

## Answer
**Proceed with Balanced approach now; defer Bold approach 1 quarter**

## Because
• **Right-time opportunity**: Current inefficiencies costing $${costNaive}/month with clear optimization path
• **Proven ROI**: 60% cost reduction achievable with medium effort and low risk
• **Strategic alignment**: Builds foundation for future zero-based redesign when scale demands it

## What (Scope Today)
• Implement batching and caching optimizations
• Add intelligent workflow decomposition
• Create monitoring and performance tracking
• Establish baseline metrics for future optimization

## Risks & Mitigations
• **Implementation complexity**: Mitigate with phased rollout and comprehensive testing
• **Performance regression**: Mitigate with A/B testing and rollback procedures  
• **Team capacity**: Mitigate with clear task prioritization and external support if needed

## Options
• **Conservative**: Low-risk caching only - safe but limited impact
• **Balanced ✅**: Comprehensive optimization - optimal risk/reward balance
• **Bold (Zero-Based)**: Complete redesign - high impact but premature timing

## ROI Snapshot

| Option        | Effort | Impact | Est. Cost | Timing |
|---------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Conservative  | Low    | Med    | $${Math.floor(costNaive * 0.7)}/mo   | Now    |
| Balanced ✅   | Med    | High   | $${costBalanced}/mo   | Now    |
| Bold (ZBD)    | High   | VeryH  | $${costBold}/mo   | Later  |

## Right-Time Recommendation

**Execute Balanced approach immediately.** Current pain point ($${costNaive}/month waste) justifies medium investment for 60% savings. Bold approach requires architectural maturity we'll gain through Balanced implementation. Timing aligns with team capacity and strategic roadmap priorities.

**Next milestone**: Validate Balanced approach success metrics in 6 weeks, then evaluate Bold approach feasibility for Q2 planning.`;
